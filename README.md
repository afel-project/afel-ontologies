# AFEL Project ontologies

This project tracks the development and evolution of the data model used throughout the AFEL project.

## Sources

The language for the ontology source code is in the [Manchester OWL Syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-manchester-syntax/), as it allows the most immutable representation of ontology statements, without depending on specific conventions for an RDF representation. Published versions will be available in RDF.
